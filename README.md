# TradingAgentsGUI

A GUI / front-end project for the [TradingAgents](https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents) multi-agent LLM financial trading framework. This repository contains the **"The Bazaar"** alternative UI prototype and the **"Traders of the Round Table"** castle-themed UI pack, built on top of the upstream TradingAgents backend.

> **🔴 Live demo:** [static-demo-gules.vercel.app](https://static-demo-gules.vercel.app) — *Traders of the Round Table* council debate with canned data, no backend required. The demo source lives in [`web-ui/static-demo/`](web-ui/static-demo/).

## The Bazaar -- TradingAgents Alternative UI Prototype

A character-driven conversational trading interface. Summon your analyst team, watch them debate in real time as distinct personas, and receive a dramatic verdict on your trade.

The UI lives in `web-ui/frontend/the-bazaar/`. See its [README](web-ui/frontend/the-bazaar/README.md) for full design notes, and the [castle UI pack README](web-ui/frontend/the-bazaar/README%202castle.md) for the Round Table theme.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Make sure the TradingAgents backend is running first:
cd web-ui
bash start.sh

# Then open the prototype, or serve with a static file server:
python3 -m http.server 8081
# then visit http://localhost:8081
```

The prototype connects to the existing TradingAgents API at `http://localhost:8000` by default. Set `?api=http://other-host:8000` to change the backend URL.

### Design System

The Bazaar is the recommended primary UI concept from the TradingAgents redesign project. Its key principles are a **warm, inviting atmosphere** (amber/gold on dark earth tones); a **character-driven** approach where each analyst is a distinct persona with avatar, color, and voice; a **conversational** flow where analysis unfolds as a chat between agents and user; and **lively animations** including typing indicators, entrance animations, and dramatic verdict reveals.
